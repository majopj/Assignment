## 1.finds a number is palindrome or not
### introduction
This program checks if an integer is a palindrome,meaning the number reversed is the same number
### working
The code creates a function that takes an integer as an argument.There is two variable,one is to store the orginal number and the other is to store the reversal.Then compare the two variables,if they are equal then the number is a palindrome, and if they are not equal then the number is not a palindrome.
