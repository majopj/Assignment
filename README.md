## 3.sum of series
### introduction
The code disply the sum of following series:1/1!+2/2!+3/3!+.....N/N!
### working
The function accepts an integer number upto which the sum of series has to found.There is two variable one is to store the factorial(fact) and the other is to store the result(res).res is initialised to 0 and fact to 1.The sum is calculated through a for loop using the range inputted.
